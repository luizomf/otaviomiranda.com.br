# AGENTS

See **CLAUDE.md** for full project context and workflow.

## Quick rules

- PT-BR in chat · English in code, commits, file names.
- Small conventional commits. Reference the Issue number (`closes #N`).
- Workflow: GitHub Issue → commits → PR → merge.
- Never commit `.agents/` or secrets.
- Install hooks once per clone: `npm run hooks:install`.
